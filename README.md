# Enhance Map Plugin #

The “4Cs Dashboard” is a descriptive learning analytics dashboard for promoting 
the practice of four learning behaviours among students. These are called “Consume”, 
“Create”, “Connect” and “Contribute” behaviours. Those behaviours can be considered 
as representative of the way in which Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) takes place in 
professional learning online communities. The “4Cs Dashboard” plugin, as an interactive 
visual representation, allows students to self-monitor their own learning behaviors,
providing them with two different views: individual and collective (i.e., “Nurse Sally’s 
4Cs Dashboard”).
